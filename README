easy-install

This is the source code repository for the script which makes the SDK installation easier.

According to XL documentation at http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/xl-compiler/eval/ppc64le/,
the proper way to install IBM XL C/C++ for Linux, V13.1.4, Community Edition is by invoking

- for yum based distros:

sudo yum install xlc.13.1.4 xlc-license-community.13.1.4 --exclude xlc-license-eval.13.1.4
sudo /opt/ibm/xlC/13.1.4/bin/xlc_configure

- for zypper and apt-get:

sudo apt-get|zypper install xlc.13.1.4 xlc-license-community.13.1.4
sudo /opt/ibm/xlC/13.1.4/bin/xlc_configure

The script has been changed to properly install this edition.
